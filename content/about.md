# My Journey

## Software Engineer at _[Sinch](https://sinch.com)_
Here, I gained my expertise in React by utilizing it to develop Micro Frontends.

I established continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using GitLab.

Additionally, I wrote Python scripts and enhanced as well as maintained internal tools.

I also took an active role in team rituals, including daily stand-ups, sprint planning sessions, tactical meetings, and retrospectives.

## Apprenticeship at _[/ut7](https://ut7.fr)_
This is where I had my first professional experience and learned about agile values and principles, as well as how to do TDD and OOP.
I was also introduced to the concept of open forums, where I developed an interest in new technologies like VueJS.
